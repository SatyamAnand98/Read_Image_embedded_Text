# Read_Image_embedded_Text

This code will recognize and “read” the text embedded in images using Python-tesseract.
Python-tesseract is an optical character recognition (OCR) tool for python.

this tutorial is for linux users.

Before executing the program:
1. Install pytesseract.
2. Intsall tesseract using pip or apt

  pip install pytesseract
  
        or
        
  sudo apt install tesseract-ocr
  
  sudo apt install libtesseract-dev
  
 If you're installing pytesseract using pip, there is a chance of getting an error:
  
  pytesseract.pytesseract.TesseractNotFoundError: tesseract is not installed or it's not in your path
  
  So it is better to install using apt.
  
  
 Thank you.
